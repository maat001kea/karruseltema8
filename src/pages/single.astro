      description="Born in 1989 in Bordeaux, Anetha has been mixing since the age of 16, introduced to techno music by her father, a Kraftwerk fan and amateur DJ. Without classical musical training, she graduated in architecture. She began her career as a professional DJ in 2013, during a stay of a few months in London where she mixed in clubs such as Corsica Studios. She recorded her first sessions there in the studio of her roommates, sound engineers. Back in France, she set up her own studio in her Parisian apartment."
